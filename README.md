# Java Application Deployment Pipeline	
---
## Designed and implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a Java application using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and ArgoCD, with IaC via Terraform on AWS. Integrated ECR, Prometheus/Grafana/Loki for observability, and implemented GitOps workflows for scalable, secure, and production-ready deployments.
---
### Multi-Repo Jenkins Pipeline with Shared Library â€“ Developed a reusable Jenkins Shared Library (fb branch, Repo A) and integrated it with a Jenkinsfile (fp branch, Repo B) to implement modular, maintainable CI/CD pipelines across multiple projects.
